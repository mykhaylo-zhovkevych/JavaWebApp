## Introduction

This project was for me like starting to learn Java from a web perspective. The code is wholly written in Jakarta EE without any frameworks at the backend.

## Features

Here are some of the standout features of our project:

- **Feature 1**: [A system is made where only one root user is allowed to be registered from the GUI side, so only the root user can add another root users manually in MySQL.]
- **Feature 2**: [This code has a couple of filters that prevent just writing the correct URL, and this code uses sessions for user management. This code uses its own implementation of Servlet Utility that allows for a more flexible outcome.]
- **Feature 3**: [This code has for the general user some encryption generator and a not fully implemented file upload feature in JS.]
